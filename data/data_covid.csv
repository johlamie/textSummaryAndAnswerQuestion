(Full protection requires two doses, so most people have only gotten their first.) If you’d like to track the rollout of the vaccine, here and abroad, here are the websites that will help you do so.

CDC vaccine tracker
The CDC’s page is here, and it shows the total doses distributed and administered, alongside a map showing how many people per state have received a dose of the vaccine, as seen in the image above.

You can look at the state map in either number of people vaccinated per 100,000 population, or just a raw count of people vaccinated so far. There are also counts available for US territories, plus four agencies: the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Defense, Indian Health Services, and the Veterans Health Administration.

The page also includes a count of vaccines distributed and administered to long-term care facilities (like nursing homes). So far 3.2 million doses have been shipped for use in these facilities, and just under half a million have been given to residents and staff.

Global data
Our World in Data has a page with a variety of charts on vaccine administration in all the world’s countries. You can watch an animated map that shows doses per 100,000 people ticking up over time, an animated bar chart of the same, and further maps of total doses administered.
There are also maps and charts showing doses administered per day, both in total and as a proportion of population. Another map color-codes countries according to their policy: whether they are vaccinating one or several high-risk groups, or whether vaccine availability is intended to be universal. (The US is currently listed as vaccinating two of the vulnerable groups, although not all states are following the CDC policy.)";;Lifehacker.com

They aren’t the first animals to contract the coronavirus in this pandemic, and they probably won’t be the last.

Which animals can get the coronavirus?
Besides the gorillas, we know that some tigers and lions at the Bronx zoo tested positive for COVID in April. Studies conducted by veterinarians have also found COVID in cats and dogs who picked up the coronavirus from their human families. And perhaps most concerning, there have been outbreaks in mink at fur farms in multiple countries.

Scientists aren’t too surprised that the coronavirus can sometimes jump species; other (non-pandemic) coronaviruses have been known to infect dogs and other animals.

Can animals give the coronavirus to humans?
Not usually. The dogs, cats, and zoo animals who have COVID seem to have picked it up from people, not the other way around.

But the mink are different. Mink in European fur farms caught the coronavirus, passed it to each other, and were apparently able to infect humans. The Danish government, noting that mutations traced to mink were present in at least a dozen human cases of COVID, ordered that all farmed mink in the country be killed.

What happens when an animal gets the coronavirus?
Some of the animals that tested positive for COVID exhibited respiratory symptoms, like coughing and shortness of breath.

If your pet seems to be sick, consult a veterinarian for advice. Since COVID cases in animals are rare, they may not necessarily recommend a COVID test, but they can provide appropriate care and advice depending on your pet’s symptoms.

What should I do if I have a pet?
“Treat pets as you would other human family members,” the CDC advises. This means keeping them away from other people and pets that don’t live in your household. This includes keeping cats indoors and walking dogs on a leash to make sure they’re not interacting with others when they’re out of your sight.

Both the CDC and the American Veterinary Medical Association agree that pets don’t commonly get the coronavirus; it’s possible, they say, but rare.";;Lifehacker.com

Here’s a summary of the plan.

Billed as the American Rescue Plan, the package includes funding for vaccinations, state and local governments, and $1 trillion in direct financial relief for Americans. It’s not certain that all these measures will all survive as they wind their way through Congress, but here’s the plan for direct relief, as it stands for now:

A third round of relief checks: The plan calls for $1,400 checks for “eligible” recipients (presumably based on similar income thresholds used for previous checks), which, with the $600 checks being sent out now, totals $2,000. The plan also expands relief check eligibility to adult dependents and all mixed status households in which one family member is a non-citizen.
Additional unemployment aid: Weekly unemployment checks would include a $400 top-up in federal funds, as the plan calls for increasing the existing $300 subsidy by an additional $100. The president-elect is also proposing to extend these enhanced unemployment benefits through September 2021.
Rental assistance: An additional $25 billion in rental assistance funding would be provided to lower-income households who have lost jobs during the pandemic. These funds would beef up the $25 billion in rental assistance that’s available now. Another $5 billion has been earmarked for people struggling to pay overdue utility bills.
An extended eviction moratorium: As expected, the plan extends the federal eviction moratorium to September 30 (it currently expires January 31). There’s also some relief for people with federally-guaranteed mortgages, as they would be able to apply for forbearance until September 30, as well.
A $15 hourly minimum wage: The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, and it would be raised to $15 an hour under Biden’s plan, which also calls for the end of tipped minimum wage (currently $2.13 per hour for people who receive at least $30 per month in tips) and sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities. Minimum wage was last raised in 2009.
More money for child care: Biden wants to create a $25-billion “Emergency Stabilization Fund” for child care providers to help pay for rent, utilities, payroll, and COVID-prevention costs. An additional $15 billion would also be added to existing grant programs. Biden also wants to expand the child tax credit to $3,000 from $2,000 for each child age 17 and younger. Children under age six would be eligible for $3,600.
Healthcare relief: To help people who have lost employee-sponsored health insurance, Biden wants to expand the Affordable Care Act’s premium subsidies so that enrollees don’t pay more than 8.5% of their income for coverage. The plan also allocates $20 billion to cover the healthcare needs of veterans, as well as $4 billion in funding for mental health and substance abuse services.
Restoration of emergency paid leave: The plan would reinstate paid sick and family leave benefits that recently expired, and extends them until September 30, while also closing some loopholes so that more people would be eligible (including federal workers). People who are away from work for COVID-related reasons would receive 14 weeks of paid leave. The federal government would reimburse employers with fewer than 500 workers for the full cost of providing the leave.
Food relief: The plan calls for $3 billion to help women, infants, and children secure food, and it would also give U.S. territories $1 billion in nutrition assistance. The 15% increase in food stamp benefits that’s set to expire in June would be extended till September.";;Lifehacker.com

But if you do have an unavoidable need to travel to a different country, youâ€™ll need to prove you donâ€™t have COâ€¦;https://lifehacker.com/you-now-have-to-prove-you-dont-have-covid-before-flying-1846057851;https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/d06r7eeglnkalzo2jrcz.jpg;2021-01-14T18:30:00Z;"With COVID-19 cases surging in the United States and abroad, there’s really no justifiable reason to travel internationally for pleasure right now. But if you do have an unavoidable need to travel to a different country, you’ll need to prove you don’t have COVID before you return. The Centers for Disease Control has instituted a new policy requiring anyone returning to the United States from abroad to supply a negative COVID test (or proof of recovery from the virus) before stepping onboard a plane.

The policy goes into effect on Jan. 26, and will put the onus entirely on airlines to refuse seats to passengers who fail to comply or meet the requirements.
PCR tests or proof of recovery are required
The CDC’s order requires anyone traveling to the United States from abroad to provide proof of a negative test obtained no more than three days prior to their departing flight. If a traveler has tested positive for the virus within the last three months, they must provide proof of their recovery from a licensed healthcare professional or healthcare official.

Antibody tests don’t satisfy the CDC’s rules, and the announcement makes no mention of rapid tests. It’s probably the best course of action to get a PCR swab test if you have to travel internationally. If a traveler fails to present a negative test on the required timeline, the airline is mandated to refuse that traveler entry to the plane, per the CDC.

To display proof of test results, the CDC recommends bringing a “paper or electronic copy of their test result for review by the airline before you board and for potential review by public health officials after you arrive in the US.”

If you’re supplying proof of recovery from COVID, the CDC requires travelers to comply with the guidelines below:

You may travel instead with documentation of your positive viral test results and a letter from your healthcare provider or a public health official that states you have been cleared for travel. The positive test result and letter together are referred to as “documentation of recovery.”

If you wind up testing positive before your return flight, expect an impromptu quarantine in your vacation destination. Airlines aren’t likely to reimburse you for a missed flight due to a positive test. The rules apply to “all air passengers, 2 years of age or older, traveling into the US, including US citizens and legal permanent residents,” the agency says.

Why travel internationally right now?
International travel has tanked during the pandemic, understandably. Americans are still barred from entering most of Europe, and many of the destinations currently open to U.S. travelers are in the Caribbean, Mexico, South, and Central America, and Africa—all of which impose their own varying levels of coronavirus restrictions on entering travelers.

On Dec. 28, the CDC began requiring U.S.-bound travelers from the United Kingdom to produce a negative coronavirus test, though the directive now applies to everyone bound for the states.

Where do you get tested in a foreign country?
No matter where you are, you’ll have to be able to find a legitimate medical clinic with access to a supporting lab that supplies legitimate results so you can ensure you are meeting the guidelines for your return trip.

As USA Today recommends, airlines and tourism boards can likely help you in this pursuit:

Look for guidance from airlines, hotels, tourism bureaus and health care providers in the coming weeks. Travelers to Hawaii have to provide a negative test to enter the state and bypass a mandatory quarantine, and airlines and tourism officials have provide extensive details on testing options. American Airlines said it will not be providing tests for passengers.

People who’ve been vaccinated still need to show test results
Given the early stages of the U.S.’ vaccination program, most people won’t be inoculated from COVID for a while. But even if you have been vaccinated, the CDC still wants you to get a test if you’re returning from abroad.

There’s no timeline for when these requirements might be lifted, but you can expect them to remain in place as long as the pandemic continues to batter the country (and the world).";;Lifehacker.com
Adam Rogers;Bidenâ€™s Covid Plan Will Define His Presidency;Itâ€™s not just about the pandemic. How the new administration handles Covid-19 will be a test of every one of its policiesâ€”and its values.;https://www.wired.com/story/bidens-covid-plan-will-define-his-presidency/;https://media.wired.com/photos/6000b2c499fa904d14740fd6/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Science_biden_covid_1230217745.jpg;2021-01-20T12:00:00Z;"ON DAY ZERO of the presidential administration of Joe Biden, the single priority of the federal government must be Covid-19. Without torquing the numbers of deaths and infections downward, no other policy—economic improvement, immigration reform, even a serious approach to stopping climate change—can happen. And that sentence works in reverse too; dealing with Covid-19 is dealing with all that other stuff.

Like any big machine, the federal government’s public health system takes time and energy to come up to speed. It hasn’t functioned at its peak efficiency during the administration of Donald Trump. So nothing will change at first. And then something will. And then everything will.

Assuming all goes as planned. For the last year, nothing has gone as planned, when there was a plan at all.

So, the new plan: Last week, Biden laid out a new, more aggressive approach, part of a promise to let science lead policy during his term. The US public health system, broken and underfunded, hasn’t been able to cope with the pandemic, leaving vaccines as the best and only hope, for now, of controlling it. But for all the blazing speed of their development and testing, vaccine rollout has been, in Biden’s (and everyone else’s) words, “a dismal failure.” Biden has now set a goal of giving 100 million shots of vaccine in the first 100 days of the administration. (As of January 19, the number in the US was 14.7 million, according to Bloomberg’s tracker.)

That won’t be easy, but it is possible. Biden proposed opening up who’s allowed to get vaccinated—sidestepping the tier system recommended to states by various government panels in an attempt to ensure equity along with speedy shot-giving. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will build 100 mass vaccination centers in places like stadiums and convention centers, and the feds will deploy mobile vaccination clinics as well—run, Biden said, by FEMA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and staffed by the public health corps, retired medical professionals, even the military.

Of course, to make all that work, the government will need to increase vaccine production and improve distribution. Last week, outgoing Health and Human Services secretary Alexander Azar also proposed releasing doses that had been “held back” to guarantee the second shots required by both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and opening up vaccinations to everyone over 65 years old. That was just before The Washington Post reported that there wasn’t enough vaccine to go around. “Our plan is as clear as it is bold: Get more people vaccinated for free. Create more places for them to get vaccinated. Mobilize more medical teams to get shots into people’s arms. Increase supply and get it out the door as soon as possible,” Biden said on Friday. “This is going to be one of the most challenging efforts ever undertaken by our country, but you have my word, we will manage the hell out of this operation.”
(Biden also said he’d mandate mask-wearing wherever federal policy allowed him to do so, and ask everyone else to mask up. That’s one of the only public health efforts that could have some real effect, but the politicization of mask use has hampered its effectiveness. “Quite frankly, it was shocking to see members of Congress, while the capitol was under siege by a deadly mob of thugs, refuse to wear masks while they were in secure locations,” Biden said. “Republican colleagues refusing to put them on—what the hell’s the matter with them? It’s time to grow up.”)
These are all not only good ideas, but the only ideas. Their success or failure will be the encryption key to the rest of the Biden presidency. Biden acknowledged that these plans need a lot of money, which means they need Congress. But, like, these moves are what public health professionals have been begging the government to do for a year.

The fact is, the feds don’t have many other levers they can pull. When it comes to public health, the United States is all but unique among advanced industrial nations in not having a single unified system. “We are 50 states and several territories, and virtually all aspects of public health and public health law are at the state and territorial level,” says Art Reingold, an epidemiologist at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health. “So the federal government can facilitate. The federal government can provide. The federal government can bribe. The federal government can coerce. But we’re not one system.” So Biden’s federal government has to instigate, to work the gaps.
State public health agencies wanted clear information on numbers of infections and, more recently, vaccine doses available. They wanted access to resources like protective equipment without having to compete with other states to get it. And they wanted funding to shore up a denuded infrastructure. As I’ve written before, pandemics don’t happen only because of the transmission dynamics of a disease. They’re a consequence of sociopolitical structures. Countries with well-funded, high-functioning public health systems and the support of their governments simply haven’t seen the kind of illness and death that the United States has. In the last decade, funding for public health preparedness has declined by half at the CDC. A study by Kaiser Health News and the Associated Press this summer found that public health funding in states has gone down 16 percent since 2010, with 38,000 state and local public health workers losing their jobs since 2008.
“Most states and locals do know what they need, if they have some resources—things like IT systems and employment systems,” says Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “That means we’ll have more accurate data so we actually do know what the current level of vaccine administration is, and it means the systems and appointments work a little better.” Information goes a long way toward calming people down, even if the information itself isn’t the best news. It’d be nice to know if you were number gazillion in line to get your shot, or number gazillion-plus-one.
Plescia also emphasized what other public health experts told me—that restoring the power of the CDC as the preeminent federal public health agency will help a lot, in terms of confidence and distribution of information. Rochelle Walensky, Biden’s nominee to run the agency, is widely respected in US public health, and she has already acknowledged that its scientists were muzzled early during the pandemic. “They need to put CDC forward as the lead agency on this and let them do what they do well,” Plescia says. “We wouldn’t really contact anybody else. Not that there’s any animosity. It’s just, that’s where you go.”
At a seminar sponsored by Johns Hopkins University last week, a member of the Biden team’s Covid-19 task force added even more specificity to the federal plan. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease physician at New York University, acknowledged that vaccinations have been going slowly—in part, she said, because of the complex recommendations from groups like the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. “Some of the guidance of CDC and ACIP, while very well intentioned in terms of trying to prevent disease and death and do so equitably, the vaccination recommendations have just been very hard to operationalize on the ground,” Gounder said. “We essentially need to make things simpler.”
Even if vaccine manufacturing keeps getting better instead of worse—no guarantee—the logistics of “everyone just come on down” have already proven, in Florida among other places, to lead to disastrous lines and chaos. Making more people eligible doesn’t mean there will be enough people to administer the shots. “Part of the problem is there aren’t enough people to actually do the injections, in addition to the actual lack of vaccines,” says Nicole Huberfeld, a health law and policy professor at Boston University. “The money is helpful. It isn’t everything, but it makes it so that it’s possible to get set up. The staffing is the question mark, in addition to the actual vaccine supply.”
This balance will also be the first test of the Biden administration’s values. ACIP’s recommendations attempted to address both a tight vaccine supply and the consequences of an inequitable society. “I feel like we’re so focused on the efficiency metric at a national level that we’re losing sight of the equity metric,” says Grace Lee, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Children’s Health and a member of ACIP. “There’s scientific underpinning for why those recommendations exist, and it's because of the inequitable distribution of the burden of disease, the burden of hospitalization, and the burden of death. I agree we need to vaccinate everybody as quickly as possible, but we have to be thoughtful and flexible about implementation.”

The values fight only gets bigger from there—and will sharply contrast the Biden administration with Trump policies. If the federal government had made open enrollment into the ACA easier, more people would’ve been part of a system that could have reported insurance enrollment and demographic numbers to a central clearinghouse. Separately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service could have shared data about what kinds of treatments were working for Covid-19 sooner. If state public health agencies had maintained large disease surveillance teams and contact tracers, they could’ve deployed a year ago. “These atmospherics are all of the ways that health care has been undermined for the last several years,” Huberfeld says. “The circumstances before the pandemic are absolutely feeding how bad the pandemic is.”

A national housing crisis meant people were crowded into too-small living spaces with too many other people, letting the disease spread. A national health care crisis meant people had no access to physicians and had preexisting conditions that made them more prone to serious illness when infected with the virus. A national labor crisis meant people had to work in jobs that put them at risk of infection, or not work at all. A lack of federal policymaking on any subject other than immigration restriction and lowering the tax burden of the wealthy meant that nobody was paying attention to signs of impending catastrophe, much less actual catastrophe. “One of the leadership issues for the Trump team has been that it’s been a revolving door, so someone’s always learning the ropes. This is a team for Biden that knows their way around. There’s less startup and more diving in,” Huberfeld says. “It doesn’t have to be as hard as it has been. Centralized decisionmaking will be more evidence-based, and oriented toward working with states and reducing risk. Those are not necessarily what those approaches have been to this point, to put a fine point on it.”

And if all that works, the Biden administration’s pandemic response could also be its best argument to those 42 percent of people who, according to a CBS News poll, think the new president’s biggest challenge is political division. More than half of Republican voters say they don’t believe Biden’s election was legitimate; maybe the best way to get them on board will be to give them a country where it’s safe to go to restaurants again, where schools are open, and 4,000 people aren’t dying every day.

“You’re killing me! This whole thing is! We’ve got all the damn cases,” Mr. Trump yelled at Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, during a gathering of top aides in the Oval Office on Aug. 19. “I want to do what Mexico does. They don’t give you a test till you get to the emergency room and you’re vomiting.”

Mexico’s record in fighting the virus was hardly one for the United States to emulate. But the president had long seen testing not as a vital way to track and contain the pandemic but as a mechanism for making him look bad by driving up the number of known cases.

And on that day he was especially furious after being informed by Dr. Francis S. Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, that it would be days before the government could give emergency approval to the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment, something Mr. Trump was eager to promote as a personal victory going into the Republican National Convention the following week.

“They’re Democrats! They’re against me!” he said, convinced that the government’s top doctors and scientists were conspiring to undermine him. “They want to wait!”
Throughout late summer and fall, in the heat of a re-election campaign that he would go on to lose, and in the face of mounting evidence of a surge in infections and deaths far worse than in the spring, Mr. Trump’s management of the crisis — unsteady, unscientific and colored by politics all year — was in effect reduced to a single question: What would it mean for him?

The result, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former administration officials and others in contact with the White House, was a lose-lose situation. Mr. Trump not only ended up soundly defeated by Joseph R. Biden Jr., but missed his chance to show that he could rise to the moment in the final chapter of his presidency and meet the defining challenge of his tenure.

Efforts by his aides to persuade him to promote mask wearing, among the simplest and most effective ways to curb the spread of the disease, were derailed by his conviction that his political base would rebel against anything that would smack of limiting their personal freedom. Even his own campaign’s polling data to the contrary could not sway him.

His explicit demand for a vaccine by Election Day — a push that came to a head in a contentious Oval Office meeting with top health aides in late September — became a misguided substitute for warning the nation that failure to adhere to social distancing and other mitigation efforts would contribute to a slow-rolling disaster this winter.

His concern? That the man he called “Sleepy Joe” Biden, who was leading him in the polls, would get credit for a vaccine, not him.

The government’s public health experts were all but silenced by the arrival in August of Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the Stanford professor of neuroradiology recruited after appearances on Fox News.

With Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coordinator of the White House virus task force, losing influence and often on the road, Dr. Atlas became the sole doctor Mr. Trump listened to. His theories, some of which scientists viewed as bordering on the crackpot, were exactly what the president wanted to hear: The virus is overblown, the number of deaths is exaggerated, testing is overrated, lockdowns do more harm than good.
As the gap between politics and science grew, the infighting that Mr. Trump had allowed to plague the administration’s response from the beginning only intensified. Threats of firings worsened the leadership vacuum as key figures undercut each other and distanced themselves from responsibility.

The administration had some positive stories to tell. Mr. Trump’s vaccine development program, Operation Warp Speed, had helped drive the pharmaceutical industry’s remarkably fast progress in developing several promising approaches. By the end of the year, two highly effective vaccines would be approved for emergency use, providing hope for 2021.

The White House rejected any suggestions that the president’s response had fallen short, saying he had worked to provide adequate testing, protective equipment and hospital capacity and that the vaccine development program had succeeded in record time.

“President Trump has led the largest mobilization of the public and private sectors since WWII to defeat Covid-19 and save lives,” said Brian Morgenstern, a White House spokesman.

But Mr. Trump’s unwillingness to put aside his political self-centeredness as Americans died by the thousands each day or to embrace the steps necessary to deal with the crisis remains confounding even to some administration officials. “Making masks a culture war issue was the dumbest thing imaginable,” one former senior adviser said.

His own bout with Covid-19 in early October left him extremely ill and dependent on care and drugs not available to most Americans, including a still-experimental monoclonal antibody treatment, and he saw firsthand how the disease coursed through the White House and some of his close allies.

Yet his instinct was to treat that experience not as a learning moment or an opportunity for empathy, but as a chance to portray himself as a Superman who had vanquished the disease. His own experience to the contrary, he assured a crowd at the White House just a week after his hospitalization, “It’s going to disappear; it is disappearing.”

Weeks after his own recovery, he would still complain about the nation’s preoccupation with the pandemic.

“All you hear is Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid,” Mr. Trump said at one campaign stop, uttering the word 11 times.

In the end he could not escape it.
‘The Base Will Revolt’
By late July, new cases were at record highs, defying Mr. Trump’s predictions through the spring that the virus was under control, and deaths were spiking to alarming levels. Herman Cain, a 2012 Republican presidential candidate, died from the coronavirus; the previous month he had attended a Trump rally without a mask.

With the pandemic defining the campaign despite Mr. Trump’s efforts to make it about law and order, Tony Fabrizio, the president’s main pollster, came to the Oval Office for a meeting in the middle of the summer prepared to make a surprising case: that mask wearing was acceptable even among Mr. Trump’s supporters.

Arrayed in front of the Resolute Desk, Mr. Trump’s advisers listened as Mr. Fabrizio presented the numbers. According to his research, some of which was reported by The Washington Post, voters believed the pandemic was bad and getting worse, they were more concerned about getting sick than about the virus’s effects on their personal financial situation, the president’s approval rating on handling the pandemic had hit new lows and a little more than half the country did not think he was taking the situation seriously.

But what set off debate that day was Mr. Fabrizio’s finding that more than 70 percent of voters in the states being targeted by the campaign supported mandatory mask wearing in public, at least indoors, including a majority of Republicans.

Mr. Kushner, who along with Hope Hicks, another top adviser, had been trying for months to convince Mr. Trump that masks could be portrayed as the key to regaining freedom to go safely to a restaurant or a sporting event, called embracing mask-wearing a “no-brainer.”

Mr. Kushner had some reason for optimism. Mr. Trump had agreed to wear one not long before for a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, after finding one he believed he looked good in: dark blue, with a presidential seal.

But Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff — backed up by other aides including Stephen Miller — said the politics for Mr. Trump would be devastating.

“The base will revolt,” Mr. Meadows said, adding that he was not sure Mr. Trump could legally make it happen in any case.
That was all Mr. Trump needed to hear. “I’m not doing a mask mandate,” he concluded.

Aside from when he was sick, he was rarely seen in a mask again.

The president had other opportunities to show leadership rather than put his political fortunes first.";;New York Times

We’ve been living through a time of so much uncertainty, with so many unanswered questions, and unfortunately this is still yet another gray area. Over the next year or two we’ll probably get a better sense of how long protection lasts. (That applies to the vaccine, too: we know it works for at least two months, but it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know whether immunity fades after months, or years, or lasts for a lifetime.)

So, here’s what experts are recommending: First, you may find it comforting to know you probably have some protection. That’s good news. But it’s not actionable news: You still have to do basically the same stuff as the rest of us.

It’s still important to wear masks, for example, and to abide by all the usual social distancing rules. Don’t think you can stand close and cough on people freely or anything like that.

You should also still get the vaccine when it becomes available for you. The CDC says that you shouldn’t get the vaccine while you have COVID, but that getting vaccinated after you have recovered is fine. If you got antibody treatment while you were sick, that could be a reason to delay vaccination, but the infection itself is not.";;Lifehacker.com

B.1.351 was discovered in South Africa, in samples dating back to October 2020, and it also has mutations in the spike protein. It seems to be more transmissible than typical COVID, but does not change the severity of disease. Both this variant and the one from the UK share a mutation called N501Y. A recent study, posted as a preprint, found that the Pfizer vaccine does seem to protect against variants with this mutation.

P.1 is a variant from Brazil, first detected in December 2020. It also has mutations that seem concerning, including to the spike protein. One of its mutations, E484K, may be able to evade antibodies; there’s some reason to suspect that people who have recovered from a previous case of COVID can be infected by these mutations.

CAL.20C is a variant that’s becoming popular in Los Angeles. We don’t know much about it yet.

For all of these variants, the science is still very new. The things we know about them are tentative. None of them seems to cause more severe disease; most are probably susceptible to the existing vaccines; and PCR tests still seem to be able to detect them.

They have also often become the dominant strains in their locations, but for some of the variants, there’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem in determining whether they are responsible for spikes in cases or not.

What happens now?
Two things. First, scientists are working on answering the unanswered questions about these variants.

For example, we need to find out whether they’re truly more transmissible, and if so, by how much. We need to know if the variants can evade our natural immunity (which would mean you could catch the virus twice) and whether they can evade immunity from the various vaccines and vaccine candidates that already exist. We need to know if any of the variants cause more severe disease or if there are any clinical differences. And we need to amp up our surveillance, in every country, to be able to find new variants as they emerge and watch where existing variants are taking over.

In time, if it turns out that new variants can evade existing vaccines, the vaccines may need to be updated. We do this for the flu vaccine every year; it’s possible we may have to do the same thing for the COVID vaccine.

But the other action item is simpler, if still difficult: We need to do all the same things we’ve been doing for prevention, only to a greater degree. If a variant is more transmissible, it’s even more important to wear masks and stay home and take testing seriously. It’s extra, extra important to get vaccines to people as quickly as possible. So in that sense, even if the virus changes, our most important measures for controlling it have not changed.";;Lifehacker.com
Benjamin Mazer;There Should Be a Nobel Prize for Vaccine Logistics;Immunization against Covid-19 is not going perfectly, but at least it's going. Let's give credit where it's due.;https://www.wired.com/story/there-should-be-a-nobel-prize-for-vaccine-logistics/;https://media.wired.com/photos/5ff4fb087446cc572b7838cf/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Vaccine-Distribution.jpg;2021-01-06T12:00:00Z;"I SPENT A lot of time last year thinking about how things went wrong. You can understand why. For a physician like me, the many failures of our public health and medical systems have been especially stinging. Now we’re faced with the great, dashed hope of 2021: a plague of “vaccine chaos,” where distribution chains get knotted up with disastrous delays. I expect to read much more about this in the coming months—about every dose that’s been delivered too slowly, every one that expires unused, and every Covid-denying US senator who gets their shots before your grandmother.
It’s curious that medical and scientific advances are so easily described in superlatives—miracles, breakthroughs, game changers—but their real-world implementation often ends up seeming like a catastrophe. The reason it’s so hard to put science into practice is as banal as it is complex. It’s the lesson you were taught in every history, literature, or social science class you ever took: Humans are unpredictable; society is not a controlled laboratory experiment. (Shakespeare was admittedly more poetic when he said this.) If the system does work, little credit is given. Frederick Banting and John Macleod won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of insulin, but there is no Nobel Prize for the many private companies and government regulators who ensure the cold chain actually delivers insulin to those in need. Maybe there should be, for the field of logistics.
I wonder how we got to this point, where any public institution not achieving immediate perfection is deemed a failure. Is it just an extension of the old news saying that “if it bleeds, it leads”—that we love reading about things going horribly wrong? I remember the bad press that followed the disastrous start of Healthcare.gov, the health insurance exchange set up by the Affordable Care Act. The technical problems were substantial. After achieving what was once considered an American impossibility—meaningful health care reform—the botched online rollout brought the law back to earth. In retrospect, the improvements gained through the expansion of health insurance have been so real that all the ink spilled over early site outages seems trifling now, even a tad offensive. Obamacare made authentic progress against entrenched social inequality. Eventually, they fixed the website.
It seems likely that the vaccine rollout will look much the same after the fact. Once we are all immunized, we will celebrate the unprecedented scientific advances and administrative efforts that crushed the pandemic. In the meantime, we hear about all of the ways the vaccination campaign is going wrong. I’ve already read complaints that health care workers are being prioritized over high-risk community members, and that people in the community are being prioritized over strained health care workers. I’ve seen pundits criticize the government’s reliance on private companies for distribution and economists suggest that we should hand the reins over to private companies for distribution. We didn’t like it when Florida asked us to sign up in person for the vaccine or when they asked us to sign up online instead. American doctors have praised the UK’s decision to stretch supplies by giving only one dose to each person, while doctors in the UK decry the same thing.
I don’t mean to sound too dismissive or overly optimistic. One reason we care about institutional failures is because the consequences are real. The Covid crisis dwarfs even health care reform in its urgency and impact. Every delay in vaccination means more social disruption, more death. Glacial, unforgiving government bureaucracies can devastate lives. If we expect only mediocrity, that’s what we’ll achieve.
Practicing medicine means being intimately aware of the consequences of failure. Individual and systemic perfection is the expectation in my line of work, even when it seems amazing that our byzantine health care system works at all. There’s always a new catchphrase in health care (high reliability, six sigma, never events, zero error) that basically means the same thing: no mistakes should ever be made. That’s my personal goal, as well. Every mistake is truly calamitous for patients and providers. It’s part of what makes being a doctor so stressful. While you may have heard that doctors and nurses are suffering from burnout, the problem stems from more than overwork. Much of our stress comes from “moral injury”—that disconcerting feeling of being trapped in flawed institutions that nevertheless demand the impossible. Imagine Office Space in an ICU.
As a laboratory medicine specialist, I’ve gotten a preview of what vaccine administrators will endure. Every day I open up the news to read about all of the ways Covid testing is falling short. Then I open up social media to see endless disinformation about how “false positive” results and greedy hospitals are creating a fake pandemic. The fact that there’s a caring doctor behind every Covid test doesn’t seem to register. I don’t even try to explain anymore that. despite all of our Covid testing failures, most have not been unique to the US. It’s fine to chide the federal government for a lack of over-the-counter home testing, for instance, but we actually authorized a prescription-free home test before Canada, Germany, and many other countries did. Some perspective is in order.
What would the public discourse look like if we treated our institutions with the same mercy with which we treat each other? We should hold leaders accountable, but behind every politician are thousands of government employees just doing their jobs. The Trump era made that especially clear. Instead of the deep state, we might call it the human state. Cheering on postal workers was a nice start, even if they did lose one of my packages.
So you’ll have to indulge me if I sound too forgiving of the many bureaucrats executing our major human endeavors. This isn’t just personal compassion—an easy enough virtue to defend. How we talk about our institutions defines them. Whether they seem trustworthy or dishonest, efficient or sluggish, powerful or impotent has as much to do with the public narrative as their actual results. Some states, for example, have reduced the negative connotations associated with Medicaid and CHIP—the government health insurance programs for poor adults and kids—simply by changing their names. Signing up your kid for Georgia’s PeachCare feels less like taking the kind of government handout that’s been demonized by politicians. What are the knock-on effects of sowing casual doubt about our public institutions?

It’s possible to take forgiveness too far. There is a risk of becoming Panglossian—deciding that we already live in the best of all possible worlds as an excuse for not changing it. Given the enormous amount of money and power we bestow on governments and health care systems, it’s only right to ask for something in return. It’s even fair game to criticize us “health care heroes” when we deserve it.

So let’s instead make 2021 a year of reasonable expectations. Setting these in the face of intense, justified emotion is hard. But here’s where we might start: by valuing transparency over perfection, improvement over denial, iteration over omnipotence, and access over perfect equity. We will not administer the vaccine in the exact order that everyone just now personally decided was most fair. Our institutions will fail us this year—like they fail us every year—in ways large and small, incompetent and corrupt. But they will also accomplish tiny miracles. We can declare “the system” an irredeemable failure; or we can start to recognize, and nurture, all its strengths.";wired;Wired
